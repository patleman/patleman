# Hi there, I'm Patanjali! :man_technologist:
I am an aspiring robotics software engineer with a Master’s degree in Robotics from NYU Tandon School of Engineering and a Bachelor’s degree from Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, Delhi University, India. I am currently seeking opportunities in robotics software engineering, with a focus on control systems.

Currently, I am working as a research intern at Gen Auto AI, a startup, where I design control laws for safety-critical autonomous systems.


My current project is on developing safety-prioritized control laws in optimized control settings, where multiple constraints are dynamically prioritized and adapt to changing conditions. To enable this, I am exploring learning strategies to adjust the priority levels of constraints in real time.

I am particularly excited by the opportunity to work with real-world robotic systems, where I can apply theoretical concepts in optimization, control, and computer vision. By leveraging established frameworks, an analytical mindset, and advanced coding skills, I am driven to make a meaningful contribution to the field of robotics.
